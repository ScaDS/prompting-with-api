This folder contains the two scripts we copied to the loaner laptops. Before copying them on a thumb drive, make sure to replace the ENTER_API_KEY_HERE with an actual OPEN AI API KEY. We moved the files in the home directory and then executed there from the terminal:

```
chmod u+x *.sh
```

```
./install_script.sh
```

After that we restarted the terminal and started this:
```
./run_prompting.sh
```

On linux, we clicked the link printed in the terminal and made if Firefox Starting page.
